# Challenge description

I’ve been told that there’s a service running in our infrastructure
used by the API team to offload part of their computations. I
have a bad feeling about it! Could you take a look at it and make
sure it’s safe? There’s a rumour going around that there’s
confidential information in some file named `flag.txt`.
